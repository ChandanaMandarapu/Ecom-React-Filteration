# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Welcome to My React E-commerce App!

This project is a simple online store built using React, helping you explore various shoes. I've divided the app into different parts to make it easy to understand:

App Overview:

The main part of the app that manages everything.
It includes the Navigation bar, the display of products, recommendations, and the Sidebar for filtering options.

Filtering System:

I've created filters that help you find the shoes you want.
You can search for specific shoes using the search bar, and you can also filter by categories, colors, or price ranges using radio buttons and buttons for quick selections.

Product Display:

This section showcases the shoes based on your selections after filtering.
Each shoe is displayed with its image, title, ratings, reviews, and price.
Other Components:

The Navigation bar offers a search bar for shoe queries and icons for wishlist, shopping cart, and user accounts.
Recommendations section provides quick filters for top brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma, and Vans.
The Sidebar comprises sections for Categories (like sneakers, flats, etc.), Colors (black, blue, etc.), and Price ranges.
